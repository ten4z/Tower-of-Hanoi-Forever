The objective of this game is to move all the disks that are initially arranged on the first pin, so that in the end all available disks are in the third pin. The minimum number of movements to solve this game is given by the equation: m = (2 ^ n) -1, where m is the minimum number of motions and n is the number of disks, to solve the game with 3 disks must be used At least 7 movements. 
Game Rules:  
1: You must move one disc at a time.
